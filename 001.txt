[Puzzlemaker]I want to write a Connection puzzle, where one of the categories is about American football.[/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]
Category #1, American football actions: BLITZ, RUSH, SACK, TURNOVER, FUMBLE, TOUCHDOWN, SAFETY, SNAP, FLAG, PUNT, PASS.
A pivot word from Category #1 could be TURNOVER, which is used here to mean “loss of possession”, but it could also be a baked pastry. Therefore:
Category #2, Baked goods: TURNOVER, DANISH, CAKE, STRUDEL, MUFFIN, PIE, BUN, PIZZA, QUICHE.
Category #3, Au naturel: BARE, NAKED, NUDE, COMMANDO, UNCLAD, BUFF, EXPOSE, FLASH, NATURAL.
A pivot word from Category #3 is BUFF, which is used here as part of the phrase “in the buff” to mean someone is naked, but it could also be a manicure step. Therefore:
Category #4, Manicure terms: BUFF, TRIM, PAINT, FILE, CLIP, POLISH.

These are the pivot words:
- TURNOVER could be in either (American football actions, #1) or (Baked goods, #2).
- BUFF could be in either (Au naturel, #3) or (Manicure terms, #4).

These are bonus words combinations that have connections through categories NOT MENTIONED above, i.e. could serve as red herrings or distractions from the real categories:
- POLISH in (Manicure terms, #4) and DANISH in (Baked goods, #2) are both European nationalities, a non-existant category.
- SACK in (American football actions, #1) has connotations of (Au naturel, #3) by being slang for ballsack.
- BUN in (Baked goods, #2) has connotations of (Au naturel, #3) as it could be a colloquialism for buttocks.
- BLITZ in (American football actions, #1) and FLASH in (Au naturel, #3) are all associated with lightning, a non-existant category.
- SNAP in (American football actions, #1), FLASH in (Au naturel, #3) and EXPOSE in (Au naturel, #3) are all associated with photography, a non-existant category.

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot words and as many bonus words, whilst ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 American football actions: FUMBLE, BLITZ, SACK, SNAP
#2 Baked goods: TURNOVER, BUN, DANISH, MUFFIN
#3 Au naturel: BARE, FLASH, EXPOSE, NUDE
#4 Manicure steps: BUFF, CLIP, FILE, POLISH
