[Puzzlemaker]I want to write a Connection puzzle where one of the categories is Responses to a correct answer.[/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]
Category #1, Response to a correct answer: BINGO, AYE, FACTUAL, CORRECT, RIGHT, YES, DING, BRAVO, TRUE, AFFIRMATIVE, 100%.
A pivot word from Category #1 could be DING, which is used here as the sound of a bell, but it could also mean to make a dent (“I dinged my car”). Therefore:
Category #2, Verbs for damage: DING, NICK, WARP, CHIP, SCUFF, SCRATCH, TEAR, SNAG, TARNISH.
A pivot word from Category #2 could be CHIP, which is used here to mean “break off a small piece from some material” but it could also mean a thin slice of deep fried potatoes, like “a bag of chips”. Therefore:
Category #3, Snacks: CHIP, FRY, POPCORN, NACHO, CORNDOG, POPPER, WING, CRACKER, SLIDER, FRITTER, PRETZEL.
A pivot word from Category #3 could be is CRACKER, which is used here to mean a thin dry biscuit, but it could also be the prefix of jack, as in "crackerjack". Therefore:
Category #4: Prefixes of jack: APPLE, BLACK, CRACKER, HI, FLAP, LUMBER, UNION. 

These are the pivot words:
- DING could be in either (Response to a correct answer, #1) or (Verbs for damage, #2).
- CHIP could be in either (Verbs for damage, #2) or (Snacks, #3).
- CRACKER could be in either (Snacks, #3) or (Prefixes of jack, #4).

These are bonus words combinations that have connections through categories NOT MENTIONED above, i.e. could serve as red herrings or distractions from the real categories:
- DING in (Response to a correct answer, #1) and FLAP in (Prefixes of jack, #4) are both onomatopoeia, a non-existant category.
- FLAP in (Prefixes of jack, #4) and WING in (Snacks, #3) are both associated with birds.
- APPLE in (Prefixes of jack, #4) has connotations of (Snacks, #3) as it is a food item.
- SNAG in (Verbs for damage, #2) has connotations of (Snacks, #3) as it is an Australian slang for a sausage.

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot words and as many bonus words, whilst ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 Response to a correct answer: BINGO, TRUE, RIGHT, AYE
#2 Verbs for damage: DING, CHIP, SCRATCH, SNAG
#3 Snacks: FRY, NACHO, PRETZEL, WING
#4 Prefix to jack: CRACKER, APPLE, FLAP, LUMBER
