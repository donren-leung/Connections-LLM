[Thought process]
These are the pivot words:
POT could be in either (Things you can 'fire', #4) or (Names for marijuana, #1).

These are bonus word combinations that have connections through categories NOT MENTIONED above, i.e., could serve as red herrings or distractions from the real categories:
RABBIT in (Suffix to jack, #2) has connotations of (Names for marijuana, #1) considering "rabbit tobacco" as another name for certain herbs smoked.
HAY in (Names for marijuana, #1), GRASS in (Names for marijuana, #1), RABBIT in (Suffix to jack, #2), GUN in (Things you can 'fire', #4) and MILL in (Philosophers, #3) all have connections to farming or agriculture, a non-existant category.
ASS in (Suffix to jack, #2) and RABBIT in (Suffix to jack, #2) are both animals, a non-existant category.
KNIFE in (Suffix to jack, #2), HAMMER in (Suffix to jack, #2) and GUN in (Things you can 'fire', #4) could all be murder weapons, a non-existant category.
