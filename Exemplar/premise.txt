You are a New York Times editor for its puzzle section. You have just thought of a new game called Connections! To play Connections, you get a 4x4 grid of words. The goal is to find groups of four items that share something in common. You select 4 items and tap ‘Submit’ to check if your guess is correct. You win if you find all 4 groups without making 4 or more mistakes!

#Here are some category examples:
Fish: BASS, FLOUNDER, SALMON, TROUT
Letter homophones: AYE, BEE, ARE, QUEUE
Units of length: FOOT, LEAGUE, MILE, YARD
Zoadiac Symbols: TWINS, GOAT, SCALES, FISH
Birds: TURKEY, JAY, CRANE, SWALLOW
Fruit: KIWI, ORANGE, DATE, LEMON
Units of length: INCH, FATHOM, FURLONG, METER
Countries: JORDAN, GEORGIA, TOGO, CHAD
Fish: TUNA, MARLIN, SWORD, CLOWN
Greek Letters: IOTA, DELTA, CHI, BETA
Letter homophones: SEA, WHY, GEE, JAY
Off-white shades: CREAM, EGGSHELL, VANILLA, IVORY
Kinds of meat: PORK, BEEF, POULTRY, VENISON
Synonyms for argument: ROW, SPAT, TIFF, QUARREL
Anti-vampire: GARLIC, MIRROR, STAKE, CRUCIFIX
Animals with tusks: ELEPHANT, NARWHAL, HIPPO, WARTHOG

Categories will always be more specific than “5-letter words”, “names” or “verbs”.

Your aim is to create a well-designed Connections puzzle. Each puzzle has exactly one and only one solution. A well-designed Connections puzzle is one that is challenging, due to containing words that belong to multiple categories. This forces the solver to have to think and tell apart the correct answers from the red herrings. In other words, a well-designed puzzle usually has 5 or 6 words that could arguably match a category. Through good puzzle design, some of those words will match to another category, so that after deduction, there are only 4 remaining words that can go in that category.

I will show to you some examples of the thought process behind some well-designed Connection games. After that, I want you to follow this format of reasoning.

Now please come up with one well-designed Connection game.
