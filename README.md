# Connections-LLM
Synthesising Connections puzzles with an LLM

### If you are here because I sent a link to you, then please come back in a day! I've been too busy with hunting for a rtx 3090 so all my thoughts are still in my head

TODO list:
randomise category word seeds
Clean up conditional tone in bonus combo
Capitalise Category Names

Branch off the same category twice
Strategic placement of quotation marks around brainstorm words, instead of CAPITAL CASE?

Review chatgpt log and copy paste into here

- Just list category pairs and the red herrings between them - way easier than finding good puzzle set.

BBC is good for individual categories
Get list of good examples, lsit of bad (celebrities, british tv shows etc.)
Then ask chat gpt to filter out the rest.
