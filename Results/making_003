You are a New York Times editor for its puzzle section. You have just thought of a new game called Connections! To play Connections, you get a 4x4 grid of words. The goal is to find groups of four items that share something in common. You select 4 items and tap ‘Submit’ to check if your guess is correct. You win if you find all 4 groups without making 4 or more mistakes!

Categories will always be more specific than “5-letter words”, “names” or “verbs”.

Each puzzle has exactly one and only one solution. A well-designed Connections puzzle is one where there are words that belong to multiple categories, making the readers think and tell apart the correct answers and the red herrings.

Another way to think of it is that in a good Connection puzzle, at first glance there could be a category that is really obvious, but it has 5 or even 6 words that match it. The aim of good puzzle design is to have some other categories that accept one of those extra words, so that by deduction, there are only 4 remaining words that can go in that category.

Here are some examples of the thought process behind some well-designed Connection games.

[Puzzlemaker]I want to write a Connection puzzle, where one of the categories is about American football.[/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]
Category #1, American football actions: FUMBLE, PUNT, SACK, SNAP, TURNOVER, TOUCHDOWN, SAFETY. A pivot word which has a double meaning is TURNOVER, which is used here to mean “loss of possession”, but it could also be a baked pastry.

Therefore, Category #2, Baked goods: TURNOVER, BUN, DANISH, MUFFIN, QUICHE, PIE.

Category #3, Au naturel: BARE, NAKED, BUFF, NUDE, UNCLAD, EXPOSED. A pivot word which has a double meaning is BUFF, which is used here as part of the phrase “in the buff” to mean someone is naked, but it could also be a manicure step.

Therefore, Category #4, Manicure terms: BUFF, CLIP, PAINT, FILE, POLISH, TRIM.

I shall list the pivot words:
- TURNOVER could be in either American football actions or Baked goods.
- BUFF could be in either Au naturel or Manicure terms.

I shall also list some bonus words pairs from above that have connections across different categories, i.e. not from the same category:
- POLISH and DANISH would be good to include as they are both European nationalities

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot and bonus words, and ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 American football actions: FUMBLE, PUNT, SACK, SNAP
#2 Baked goods: TURNOVER, BUN, DANISH, MUFFIN
#3 Au naturel: BARE, NAKED, NUDE, UNCLAD
#4 Manicure steps: BUFF, CLIP, FILE, POLISH
[/Thought process]

[Puzzlemaker]I want to write a Connection puzzle where one of the categories is Responses to a correct answer.[/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]
Category #1, Response to a correct answer: BINGO, FACTUAL, CORRECT, AYE, RIGHT, YES, DING, BRAVO, TRUE. A pivot word which has a double meaning is DING, which is used here as the sound of a bell, but it could also mean to make a dent (“I dinged my car”).

Therefore, Category #2, Verbs for Damage: DING, NICK, CHIP, SCRATCH, TEAR, SNAG, TARNISH, WARP. A pivot word which has a double meaning is CHIP, which is used here to mean “break off a small piece from some material” but it could also mean a thin slice of deep fried potatoes, like “a bag of chips”. #Since CHIP is already in a category, we could create a new category to decoy it.

Therefore, Category #3, Snacks: CHIP, FRY, NACHO, POPPER, WING, CRACKER, SLIDER, FRITTER. A pivot word which could be used is CRACKER, as it could mean a thin dry biscuit, but it could also be the prefix of jack (crackerjack). 

Therefore, Category #4: Prefixes of jack: APPLE, CRACKER, FLAP, LUMBER, HI, BLACK, UNION. 

I shall list the pivot words:
- DING could be in either Response to a correct answer or Verbs for Damage.
- CHIP could be in either Verbs for Damage or Snacks.
- CRACKER could be in either Snacks or Prefixes of jack.

I shall also list some bonus words pairs from above that have connections across different categories, i.e. not from the same category:
- DING and FLAP would be good to include as they are both Onomatopoeia.
- FLAP and WING would be good to include as they have to do with birds.
- APPLE would be good to include, as it could be mistakenly grouped with the other food items in Snacks

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot and bonus words, and ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 Response to a correct answer: BINGO, CORRECT, RIGHT, FACTUAL
#2 Verbs for Damage: DING, CHIP, SCRATCH, TEAR
#3 Snacks: FRY, NACHO, POPPER, WING
#4 Prefix to jack: CRACKER, APPLE, FLAP, LUMBER
[/Thought process]

Now please come up with one well-designed Connection game after the [Thought process] tag.

[Puzzlemaker]I want to write a Connection puzzle where one of the categories is Poker Terms.[/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]
Category #1, Poker Terms: FOLD, BLUFF, ANTE, RIVER, SUITED, CHECK, CALL, RAISE, ALL-IN. A pivot word with a double meaning is "RIVER," which refers to the final community card in a Texas Hold'em game but could also be a flowing body of water in nature.

Therefore, Category #2, Geographical Features: RIVER, HILL, VALLEY, BAY, PLATEAU, CAPE, ISLAND, DELTA. A pivot word with a double meaning is "CAPE," which refers to a point of land jutting out into the sea, but it can also refer to a type of clothing item often worn by superheroes.

Therefore, Category #3, Items in Superhero Costumes: CAPE, MASK, BOOTS, BELT, GLOVES, SUIT, COWL, ARMOR. A pivot word with a double meaning is "SUIT," which can refer to the attire worn by a superhero but can also refer to a set of playing cards in a deck (hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds).

Therefore, Category #4, Playing Card Terms: SUIT, DECK, TRUMP, SPADE, CLUB, HEART, DIAMOND, QUEEN.

I shall list the pivot words:

RIVER could be in either Poker Terms or Geographical Features.
CAPE could be in either Geographical Features or Items in Superhero Costumes.
SUIT could be in either Items in Superhero Costumes or Playing Card Terms.
I shall also list some bonus words pairs from above that have connections across different categories, i.e. not from the same category:

MASK and BLUFF could be included as they both have to do with deception.
TRUMP and CALL would be good to include as they both can be associated with decision-making in games.
HILL and RAISE would be good to include as they both involve elevation.
Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot and bonus words, and ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 Poker Terms: FOLD, BLUFF, ANTE, CHECK
#2 Geographical Features: RIVER, HILL, VALLEY, BAY
#3 Items in Superhero Costumes: CAPE, MASK, BOOTS, BELT
#4 Playing Card Terms: SUIT, DECK, TRUMP, SPADE
[/Thought process]

By designing the puzzle this way, players will be able to identify several apparent but misleading connections, making the game more challenging and fun to solve.

===

Could you please redesign Category #4, as it is too similar to Category #1?

===

Certainly, let's modify Category #4 to make it distinct from the Poker Terms category while keeping the puzzle challenging and engaging.

[Updated Thought Process]

Category #1, Poker Terms: FOLD, BLUFF, ANTE, RIVER, SUITED, CHECK, CALL, RAISE, ALL-IN. The pivot word with a double meaning is "RIVER," which refers to the final community card in a Texas Hold'em game but could also be a flowing body of water.

Category #2, Geographical Features: RIVER, HILL, VALLEY, BAY, PLATEAU, CAPE, ISLAND, DELTA. A pivot word with a double meaning is "CAPE," which refers to a point of land jutting out into the sea, but it can also refer to a type of clothing item often worn by superheroes.

Category #3, Items in Superhero Costumes: CAPE, MASK, BOOTS, BELT, GLOVES, SUIT, COWL, ARMOR. A pivot word with a double meaning is "SUIT," which refers to the attire worn by a superhero but could also refer to formal business attire.

Therefore, Category #4, Business Attire: SUIT, TIE, CUFFLINKS, LOAFERS, SHIRT, BLAZER, BROGUE, SLACKS.

I shall list the pivot words:

RIVER could be in either Poker Terms or Geographical Features.
CAPE could be in either Geographical Features or Items in Superhero Costumes.
SUIT could be in either Items in Superhero Costumes or Business Attire.
I shall also list some bonus words pairs from above that have connections across different categories, i.e., not from the same category:

MASK and BLUFF could be included as they both have to do with deception.
HILL and RAISE would be good to include as they both involve elevation.
TIE and ANTE could be good to include as they both involve an initial investment or commitment.
Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot and bonus words, and ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 Poker Terms: FOLD, BLUFF, ANTE, CHECK
#2 Geographical Features: RIVER, HILL, VALLEY, BAY
#3 Items in Superhero Costumes: CAPE, MASK, BOOTS, BELT
#4 Business Attire: SUIT, TIE, CUFFLINKS, LOAFERS

This updated design should add more challenge and intrigue to the Connections puzzle.

===

This time I feel like category #4 is too similar to #3. Maybe you could make category #4 synonyms of "obscure" or "hide"? Which could form a red herring with mask.

===

You're right; having a Business Attire category can be a bit too close to the Superhero Costumes category. Changing Category #4 to synonyms of "obscure" or "hide" is a great idea, especially for the red herring effect with "MASK" from Category #3.

[Updated Thought Process]

Category #1, Poker Terms: FOLD, BLUFF, ANTE, RIVER, SUITED, CHECK, CALL, RAISE, ALL-IN. The pivot word with a double meaning is "RIVER," which refers to the final community card in a Texas Hold'em game but could also be a flowing body of water.

Category #2, Geographical Features: RIVER, HILL, VALLEY, BAY, PLATEAU, CAPE, ISLAND, DELTA. A pivot word with a double meaning is "CAPE," which refers to a point of land jutting out into the sea, but it can also refer to a type of clothing item often worn by superheroes.

Category #3, Items in Superhero Costumes: CAPE, MASK, BOOTS, BELT, GLOVES, SUIT, COWL, ARMOR. A pivot word with a double meaning is "SUIT," which refers to the attire worn by a superhero but could also refer to formal business attire.

Therefore, Category #4, Synonyms for "Obscure" or "Hide": MASK, CONCEAL, CLOAK, SHROUD, VEIL, BURY, ECLIPSE, OBSTRUCT.

I shall list the pivot words:

RIVER could be in either Poker Terms or Geographical Features.
CAPE could be in either Geographical Features or Items in Superhero Costumes.
MASK could be in either Items in Superhero Costumes or Synonyms for "Obscure" or "Hide."
I shall also list some bonus words pairs from above that have connections across different categories, i.e., not from the same category:

MASK and BLUFF could be included as they both have to do with deception.
HILL and RAISE would be good to include as they both involve elevation.
Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot and bonus words, and ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 Poker Terms: FOLD, BLUFF, ANTE, CHECK
#2 Geographical Features: RIVER, HILL, VALLEY, BAY
#3 Items in Superhero Costumes: CAPE, MASK, BOOTS, BELT
#4 Synonyms for "Obscure" or "Hide": CONCEAL, CLOAK, SHROUD, VEIL

By incorporating synonyms for "obscure" or "hide," the puzzle becomes more challenging, especially with the red herring "MASK" that could belong to two different categories.

===

Could you repeat that thought process, but in this format?
[Puzzlemaker]I want to write a Connection puzzle where one of the categories is Responses to a correct answer.[/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]
Category #1, Response to a correct answer: BINGO, AYE, FACTUAL, CORRECT, RIGHT, YES, DING, BRAVO, TRUE, AFFIRMATIVE, 100%.
A pivot word from Category #1 could be DING, which is used here as the sound of a bell, but it could also mean to make a dent (“I dinged my car”). Therefore:
Category #2, Verbs for damage: DING, NICK, WARP, CHIP, SCUFF, SCRATCH, TEAR, SNAG, TARNISH.
A pivot word from Category #2 could be CHIP, which is used here to mean “break off a small piece from some material” but it could also mean a thin slice of deep fried potatoes, like “a bag of chips”. Therefore:
Category #3, Snacks: CHIP, FRY, POPCORN, NACHO, CORNDOG, POPPER, WING, CRACKER, SLIDER, FRITTER, PRETZEL.
A pivot word from Category #3 could be is CRACKER, which is used here to mean a thin dry biscuit, but it could also be the prefix of jack, as in "crackerjack". Therefore:
Category #4: Prefixes of jack: APPLE, BLACK, CRACKER, HI, FLAP, LUMBER, UNION. 

These are the pivot words:
- DING could be in either (Response to a correct answer, #1) or (Verbs for damage, #2).
- CHIP could be in either (Verbs for damage, #2) or (Snacks, #3).
- CRACKER could be in either (Snacks, #3) or (Prefixes of jack, #4).

These are bonus words combinations that have connections through categories NOT MENTIONED above, i.e. could serve as red herrings or distractions from the real categories:
- DING in (Response to a correct answer, #1) and FLAP in (Prefixes of jack, #4) are both onomatopoeia, a non-existant category.
- FLAP in (Prefixes of jack, #4) and WING in (Snacks, #3) are both associated with birds.
- APPLE in (Prefixes of jack, #4) has connotations of (Snacks, #3) as it is a food item.
- SNAG in (Verbs for damage, #2) has connotations of (Snacks, #3) as it is an Australian slang for a sausage.

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot words and as many bonus words, whilst ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 Response to a correct answer: BINGO, TRUE, RIGHT, AYE
#2 Verbs for damage: DING, CHIP, SCRATCH, SNAG
#3 Snacks: FRY, NACHO, PRETZEL, WING
#4 Prefix to jack: CRACKER, APPLE, FLAP, LUMBER
