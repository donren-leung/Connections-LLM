You are a New York Times editor for its puzzle section. You have just thought of a new game called Connections! To play Connections, you get a 4x4 grid of words. The goal is to find groups of four items that share something in common. You select 4 items and tap ‘Submit’ to check if your guess is correct. You win if you find all 4 groups without making 4 or more mistakes!

Here are some category examples:
Fish: BASS, FLOUNDER, SALMON, TROUT
Letter homophones: AYE, BEE, ARE, QUEUE
Units of length: FOOT, LEAGUE, MILE, YARD
Zoadiac Symbols: TWINS, GOAT, SCALES, FISH
Birds: TURKEY, JAY, CRANE, SWALLOW
Fruit: KIWI, ORANGE, DATE, LEMON
Units of length: INCH, FATHOM, FURLONG, METER
Countries: JORDAN, GEORGIA, TOGO, CHAD
Fish: TUNA, MARLIN, SWORD, CLOWN
Greek Letters: IOTA, DELTA, CHI, BETA
Letter homophones: SEA, WHY, GEE, JAY
Off-white shades: CREAM, EGGSHELL, VANILLA, IVORY
Kinds of meat: PORK, BEEF, POULTRY, VENISON
Synonyms for argument: ROW, SPAT, TIFF, QUARREL
Anti-vampire: GARLIC, MIRROR, STAKE, CRUCIFIX
Animals with tusks: ELEPHANT, NARWHAL, HIPPO, WARTHOG

Categories will always be more specific than “5-letter words”, “names” or “verbs”.

Your aim is to create a well-designed Connections puzzle. Each puzzle has exactly one and only one solution. A well-designed Connections puzzle is one that is challenging, due to containing words that belong to multiple categories. This forces the solver to have to think and tell apart the correct answers from the red herrings. In other words, a well-designed puzzle usually has 5 or 6 words that could arguably match a category. Through good puzzle design, some of those words will match to another category, so that after deduction, there are only 4 remaining words that can go in that category.

I will show to you some examples of the thought process behind some well-designed Connection games. After that, I want you to follow this format of reasoning.

[Puzzlemaker]I want to write a Connection puzzle where one of the categories is Poker Terms.[/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]
Category #1, Poker Terms: FOLD, BLUFF, FLOP, ANTE, RIVER, SUITED, TURN, CHECK, STREET, CALL, RAISE, ALL-IN.
A pivot word from Category #1 could be RIVER, which refers to the final community card in a Texas Hold'em game but could also be a flowing body of water. Therefore:
Category #2, Geographical Features: RIVER, HILL, MOUNTAIN, VALLEY, BAY, PLATEAU, CAPE, ISLAND, DELTA.
A pivot word from Category #2 could be CAPE, which refers to a point of land jutting out into the sea, but it can also refer to a type of clothing item often worn by superheroes. Therefore:
Category #3, Items in Superhero Costumes: CAPE, MASK, BOOTS, BELT, GLOVES, SUIT, SHIELD, COWL, ARMOUR.
A pivot word from Category #3 could be MASK, which refers to the attire worn by a superhero but could also mean to obscure or hide something. Therefore:
Category #4, Synonyms for Obscure: MASK, CONCEAL, CLOAK, SHROUD, VEIL, DISGUISE, ECLIPSE, CAMOUFLAGE.

These are the pivot words:
- RIVER could be in either (Poker Terms, #1) or (Geographical Features, #2).
- CAPE could be in either (Geographical Features, #2) or (Items in Superhero Costumes, #3).
- MASK could be in either (Items in Superhero Costumes, #3) or (Synonyms for Obscure, #4).

These are bonus word combinations that have connections through categories NOT MENTIONED above, i.e., could serve as red herrings or distractions from the real categories:
- BLUFF in (Poker Terms, #1) has connotations of (Geographical Features, #2) as it could mean a steep cliff or bank.
- SUIT in (Items in Superhero Costumes, #3) has connotations of (Poker Terms, #1), as it could refer to the sets that a deck of cards is divided into.
- DISGUISE in (Synonyms for Obscure, #4) has connotations of (Poker Terms, #1), as it could refer to the act of making ones hand seem stronger or weaker than it is.
- CLOAK in (Synonyms for Obscure, #4) has connotations of (Items in Superhero Costumes, #3), as it could be something that a superhero might wear.

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot words and as many bonus words, while ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories, is:
#1 Poker Terms: CALL, BLUFF, RIVER, CHECK
#2 Geographical Features: VALLEY, CAPE, BAY, DELTA
#3 Items in Superhero Costumes: MASK, SUIT, BELT, SHIELD
#4 Synonyms for Obscure: ECLIPSE, CLOAK, VEIL, CONCEAL

[Puzzlemaker]I want to write a Connection puzzle where one of the categories is Responses to a correct answer.[/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]

A pivot word from Category #1 could be DING, which is used here as the sound of a bell, but it could also mean to make a dent (“I dinged my car”). Therefore:
Category #2, Verbs for damage: DING, NICK, WARP, CHIP, SCUFF, SCRATCH, TEAR, SNAG, TARNISH.
A pivot word from Category #2 could be CHIP, which is used here to mean “break off a small piece from some material” but it could also mean a thin slice of deep fried potatoes, like “a bag of chips”. Therefore:
Category #3, Snacks: CHIP, FRY, POPCORN, NACHO, CORNDOG, POPPER, WING, CRACKER, SLIDER, FRITTER, PRETZEL.
A pivot word from Category #3 could be is CRACKER, which is used here to mean a thin dry biscuit, but it could also be the prefix of jack, as in "crackerjack". Therefore:
Category #4: Prefixes of jack: APPLE, BLACK, CRACKER, HI, FLAP, LUMBER, UNION. 

These are the pivot words:
- DING could be in either (Response to a correct answer, #1) or (Verbs for damage, #2).
- CHIP could be in either (Verbs for damage, #2) or (Snacks, #3).
- CRACKER could be in either (Snacks, #3) or (Prefixes of jack, #4).

These are bonus words combinations that have connections through categories NOT MENTIONED above, i.e. could serve as red herrings or distractions from the real categories:
- DING in (Response to a correct answer, #1) and FLAP in (Prefixes of jack, #4) are both onomatopoeia, a non-existant category.
- FLAP in (Prefixes of jack, #4) and WING in (Snacks, #3) are both associated with birds.
- APPLE in (Prefixes of jack, #4) has connotations of (Snacks, #3) as it is a food item.
- SNAG in (Verbs for damage, #2) has connotations of (Snacks, #3) as it is an Australian slang for a sausage.

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot words and as many bonus words, whilst ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 Response to a correct answer: DING, 100%, FACTUAL, AYE
#2 Verbs for damage: SCUFF, SCRATCH, TEAR, SNAG
#3 Snacks: NACHO, CHIP, CRACKER, WING
#4 Prefix to jack: HI, APPLE, FLAP, UNION

These are the pivot words:
- TURNOVER could be in either (American football actions, #1) or (Baked goods, #2).
- BUFF could be in either (Au naturel, #3) or (Manicure terms, #4).

- SACK in (American football actions, #1) has connotations of (Au naturel, #3) by being slang for ballsack.

- SNAP in (American football actions, #1), FLASH in (Au naturel, #3) and EXPOSE in (Au naturel, #3) are all associated with photography, a non-existant category.

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot words and as many bonus words, whilst ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories is:
#1 American football actions: BLITZ, SACK, TURNOVER, SNAP
#2 Baked goods: BUN, DANISH, STRUDEL, MUFFIN
#3 Au naturel: FLASH, BUFF, EXPOSE, NATURAL 
#4 Manicure steps: CLIP, FILE, PAINT, POLISH

[Puzzlemaker] I want to write a Connection puzzle where one of the categories is Personal Pronouns. [/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]
Category #1, Personal Pronouns: HE, SHE, IT, HIM, HER, THEY, HIS, ITS, HERS, OUR, WE, I.
A pivot word from Category #1 could be ITS, which here means "belonging to it," but could also mean a plural abbreviation of "information technology services." Therefore:
Category #2, Technology-related abbreviations: RAM, CPU, HTML, LED, ISP, ITS, GUI, SQL, SSD, ROM.
A pivot word from Category #2 could be LED, which refers to "Light-Emitting Diode" but also could be the past tense of the verb "to lead." Therefore:
Category #3, Past Tense Verbs: LED, RAN, FELL, STOLE, BROKE, SWAM, ATE, FOUND, TOOK, HAD.
A pivot word from Category #3 could be TOOK, which refers to the past tense of "take" but also could refer to a fictional character type in "The Lord of the Rings" (like Peregrin Took). Therefore:
Category #4, Characters in "The Lord of the Rings": FRODO, SAM, GANDALF, LEGOLAS, ARAGORN, GOLLUM, BOROMIR, GIMLI, TOOK, SAURON.

These are the pivot words:

ITS could be in either (Personal Pronouns, #1) or (Technology-related abbreviations, #2).
LED could be in either (Technology-related abbreviations, #2) or (Past Tense Verbs, #3).
TOOK could be in either (Past Tense Verbs, #3) or (Characters in "The Lord of the Rings", #4).
These are bonus word combinations that have connections through categories NOT MENTIONED above, i.e., could serve as red herrings or distractions from the real categories:

RAM in (Technology-related abbreviations, #2) and WE in (Personal Pronouns, #1) are both associated with animals (a ram is a male sheep, and "ewe" is a female sheep).
LEGOLAS in (Characters in "The Lord of the Rings," #4) and LED in (Technology-related abbreviations, #2) both involve light (Legolas is an elf, and elves are often associated with light; LED stands for "Light-Emitting Diode").
FOUND in (Past Tense Verbs, #3) has connotations with ROM in (Technology-related abbreviations, #2) since both can be related to the concept of discovery or foundational software (Read-Only Memory).
Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot words and as many bonus words, while ensuring 4 words in each of the 4 categories, is:
#1 Personal Pronouns: HE, SHE, ITS, THEY
#2 Technology-related abbreviations: RAM, CPU, ITS, LED
#3 Past Tense Verbs: RAN, FELL, LED, TOOK
#4 Characters in "The Lord of the Rings": FRODO, SAM, GANDALF, TOOK
