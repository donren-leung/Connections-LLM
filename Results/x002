You are a New York Times editor for its puzzle section. You have just thought of a new game called Connections! To play Connections, you get a 4x4 grid of words. The goal is to find groups of four items that share something in common. You select 4 items and tap ‘Submit’ to check if your guess is correct. You win if you find all 4 groups without making 4 or more mistakes!

Here are some category examples:
Fish: BASS, FLOUNDER, SALMON, TROUT
Letter homophones: AYE, BEE, ARE, QUEUE
Units of length: FOOT, LEAGUE, MILE, YARD
Zoadiac Symbols: TWINS, GOAT, SCALES, FISH
Birds: TURKEY, JAY, CRANE, SWALLOW
Fruit: KIWI, ORANGE, DATE, LEMON
Units of length: INCH, FATHOM, FURLONG, METER
Countries: JORDAN, GEORGIA, TOGO, CHAD
Fish: TUNA, MARLIN, SWORD, CLOWN
Greek Letters: IOTA, DELTA, CHI, BETA
Letter homophones: SEA, WHY, GEE, JAY
Off-white shades: CREAM, EGGSHELL, VANILLA, IVORY
Kinds of meat: PORK, BEEF, POULTRY, VENISON
Synonyms for argument: ROW, SPAT, TIFF, QUARREL
Anti-vampire: GARLIC, MIRROR, STAKE, CRUCIFIX
Animals with tusks: ELEPHANT, NARWHAL, HIPPO, WARTHOG

Categories will always be more specific than “5-letter words”, “names” or “verbs”.

Your aim is to create a well-designed Connections puzzle. Each puzzle has exactly one and only one solution. A well-designed Connections puzzle is one that is challenging, due to containing words that belong to multiple categories. This forces the solver to have to think and tell apart the correct answers from the red herrings. In other words, a well-designed puzzle usually has 5 or 6 words that could arguably match a category. Through good puzzle design, some of those words will match to another category, so that after deduction, there are only 4 remaining words that can go in that category.

I will show to you some examples of the thought process behind some well-designed Connection games. After that, I want you to follow this format of reasoning.

[Puzzlemaker]I want to write a Connection puzzle, where one of the categories is about American football.[/Puzzlemaker]
[Thought process]
Category #1, American football actions: BLITZ, RUSH, SACK, TURNOVER, FUMBLE, TOUCHDOWN, SAFETY, SNAP, FLAG, PUNT, PASS.
A pivot word from Category #1 could be TURNOVER, which is used here to mean “loss of possession”, but it could also be a baked pastry. Therefore:
Category #2, Baked goods: TURNOVER, DANISH, CAKE, STRUDEL, MUFFIN, PIE, BUN, PIZZA, QUICHE.
Category #3, Au naturel: BARE, NAKED, NUDE, COMMANDO, UNCLAD, BUFF, EXPOSE, FLASH, NATURAL.
A pivot word from Category #3 is BUFF, which is used here as part of the phrase “in the buff” to mean someone is naked, but it could also be a manicure step. Therefore:
Category #4, Manicure terms: BUFF, TRIM, PAINT, FILE, CLIP, POLISH.

These are the pivot words:
- TURNOVER could be in either (American football actions, #1) or (Baked goods, #2).
- BUFF could be in either (Au naturel, #3) or (Manicure terms, #4).

These are bonus words combinations that have connections through categories NOT MENTIONED above, i.e. could serve as red herrings or distractions from the real categories:
- POLISH in (Manicure terms, #4) and DANISH in (Baked goods, #2) are both European nationalities, a non-existant category.
- SACK in (American football actions, #1) has connotations of (Au naturel, #3) by being slang for ballsack.
- BUN in (Baked goods, #2) has connotations of (Au naturel, #3) as it could be a colloquialism for buttocks.
- BLITZ in (American football actions, #1) and FLASH in (Au naturel, #3) are all associated with lightning, a non-existant category.
- SNAP in (American football actions, #1), FLASH in (Au naturel, #3) and EXPOSE in (Au naturel, #3) are all associated with photography, a non-existant category.

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot words and as many bonus words, whilst ensuring 16 unique words divided equally amongst the 4 categories is:
#1 American football actions: FUMBLE, BLITZ, SACK, SNAP
#2 Baked goods: TURNOVER, BUN, DANISH, MUFFIN
#3 Au naturel: BARE, FLASH, EXPOSE, NUDE
#4 Manicure steps: BUFF, CLIP, FILE, POLISH

A pivot word from Category #2 could be CHIP, which is used here to mean “break off a small piece from some material” but it could also mean a thin slice of deep fried potatoes, like “a bag of chips”. Therefore:

A pivot word from Category #3 could be is CRACKER, which is used here to mean a thin dry biscuit, but it could also be the prefix of jack, as in "crackerjack". Therefore:
Category #4: Prefixes of jack: APPLE, BLACK, CRACKER, HI, FLAP, LUMBER, UNION. 

These are the pivot words:
- DING could be in either (Response to a correct answer, #1) or (Verbs for damage, #2).
- CHIP could be in either (Verbs for damage, #2) or (Snacks, #3).
- CRACKER could be in either (Snacks, #3) or (Prefixes of jack, #4).

These are bonus words combinations that have connections through categories NOT MENTIONED above, i.e. could serve as red herrings or distractions from the real categories:
- DING in (Response to a correct answer, #1) and FLAP in (Prefixes of jack, #4) are both onomatopoeia, a non-existant category.
- FLAP in (Prefixes of jack, #4) and WING in (Snacks, #3) are both associated with birds.
- APPLE in (Prefixes of jack, #4) has connotations of (Snacks, #3) as it is a food item.
- SNAG in (Verbs for damage, #2) has connotations of (Snacks, #3) as it is an Australian slang for a sausage.

Therefore, one of the possibilities for the final puzzle incorporating the pivot words and as many bonus words, whilst ensuring 16 unique words divided equally amongst the 4 categories is:
#1 Response to a correct answer: AFFIRMATIVE, DING, RIGHT, AYE
#2 Verbs for damage: SCRATCH, TEAR, CHIP, SNAG
#3 Snacks: CRACKER, NACHO, PRETZEL, WING
#4 Prefix to jack: APPLE, FLAP, UNION, HI
