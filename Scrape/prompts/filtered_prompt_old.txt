Hello, I'm trying to filter out certain questions from BBC2's Only Connect gameshow. Namely the ones that you would know only if you lived in the UK, and also esoteric categories that you would only know if you were a nerd, because I'm trying to create a version for common lay people.

Here are some examples:
# British sport: "English cricket captains":, "England cricket all-rounders"
# British geography: "Irish counties", "North Sea oil fields", "___ford place names"
# British politics: "Chancellors of the Exchequer"
# British pop culture. This includes TV shows, news channels, radio channels, comics, British celebrities who aren't internationally famous.
"Blackadder Goes Forth characters", "Grange Hill characters", "Original Radio 1 DJs", "Bash Street Kids"
# British General Knowledge: "High security prisons", "Morris cars"

I shall now give you some JSON of more Only Connection categories. Please pay attention to these instructions:
For each wall of each episode:
    1. Analyse in great detail both the category name, and the list of 4 answer items.
    2a. Give the reasoning as to whether the category would require native British knowledge. 
    2b. If the category does not inherently require native British knowledge, check and explain whether the answers supplied would require native British knowledge.  
    3. Given the reasoning you made, classify each category into General Category, General Category but British-oriented answers, and British Category

Let's work through an example first, with the input as

In the given answers, "Laurel" as in Stan Laurel from Laurel and Hardy is internationally known. The capital city of the Falkland Islands is Port Stanley. However, "Accrington Stanley" (a football club) and "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" (famous phrase by Henry Morton Stanley) have more British significance.

 - Classification: British Category
3. Start with "facilities": "Candle","Lavender","Bogart","Loom"
 - Analysis: The use of the term "facilities" in this context as a euphemism for toilets/bathrooms is understood internationally.

 - Analysis: The category pertains to fictional or purported aliens from various media. While "Roger" from "American Dad!" or "Paul" from the film "Paul" might be more universally known, other references might be more niche, since The Mule is a character from Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" series and Ming the Merciless is a character from the Flash Gordon comics and movies.
