Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Convert this list into JSON format: Each person is an object containing the person's first name, birth year, whether they are still alive.
If a person has children, nest those persons inside the "children" property, which is a list of person objects. If a person does not have children, then set the children to null.
Queen Elizabeth II (1926-2022) - deceased
    - Charles (1948-) - alive
        - Prince William (1982-) - alive
            - Prince George (2013-) - alive
            - Princess Charlotte (2015-) - alive
            - Prince Louis (2018-) - alive
        - Prince Harry (1984-) - alive
            - Archie (2019-) - alive
    - Princess Anne (1950-) - alive
Princess Margaret (1930-2002) - deceased

For example, this is what the object for Elizabeth II would look like (children left unfilled)
{
    "name": "Elizabeth",
    "birth_year": 1926,
    "alive": false,
    "children": []
}
